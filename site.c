 *
 * ANSI X9.9 has been withdrawn as a standard, due to the weakness
 * of DES.  An attacker can learn the token's secret by observing
 * two challenge/response pairs.  See ANSI document X9 TG-24-1999
 * <URL:http://www.x9.org/docs/TG24_1999.pdf>.
 *
 * This is not an issue for synchronous mode, where the challenge
 * is not presented.  (If the challenge is presented, e.g. for
 * user verification, but not entered, this is still a problem.
 * TRI-D plugins that use otpd do not work this way; when they do
 * present a challenge it is not the synchronous challenge.)
 *
 * But to use async (challenge/response) mode, we need to avoid
 * exposure of the challenge.  So we've implemented a site-local
 * transform feature.  This alters the presented challenge before
 * response generation; the user must make the same transformation
 * when entering the challenge into the token.  Thus, an attacker
 * does not have access to the actual challenge.
 *
 * When implementing a transform, note that trivial transforms
 * (say, append '0') are trivially attacked.  OTOH, the transform
 * must be easy enough for a user to perform quickly, and probably
 * mentally.
 *
 * Yes, this is security by obscurity.  No, it is not "secure".
 * But it is probably good enough; most attackers are just not
 * that sophisticated.  Certainly, it's better than doing nothing.
 * 
 * This only affects X9.9 tokens.  If your token vendor will not
 * reveal their algorithm to you, you should avoid doing business
 * with them.
 *
 * Instead of, or in addition to, the transform, you could restrict
 * async auth to secure terminals.
