 * The ANSI X9.9 MAC algorithm is:
 * 1. Perform a CBC mode DES encryption of the plaintext.  The last plaintext
 *    block must be zero padded.
 * 2. The MAC is the most significant 32 bits of the last cipherblock.
 *
 * Most tokens support a max of an 8 character challenge, but at least one
 * (CRYPTOCard RB-1) supports performing the full CBC mode encryption
 * of an arbitrary length challenge.  So we don't limit ourselves
 * to just an ECB mode encryption.
 *
 * This routine returns the entire 64 bit last cipherblock, at least one sync
 * mode needs this (and ANSI X9.9 states that the MAC can be 48, and 64 bit
 * MACs should be supported).  Returns 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
