    # Timeout, in ms, for each request.  This includes time to look the
    # user up (really only relevant with LDAP), time to lock state
    # (really only relevant when using gsmd), validate the OTP, and then
    # to update state (again, really only relevant with gsmd).  This must
    # be less than the client (e.g. RADIUS client on a VPN server)
    # failover timeout, so that clients do not failover to other auth
    # servers while we are still doing work.  If this value is too high,
    # then in the worst case allowing clients to failover will cause a
    # spiralling load problem which will be unrecoverable.  In the best
    # case, the system will do extra work, which will be ignored by the
    # client (since it has already timed out).
    #
    # This value is not absolute; timing data is not perfectly accounted
    # for throughout the OTP authentication path, and may slip beyond the
    # configured value.  Additionally, the start time of a request, as
    # recorded by otpd, may already be well behind the actual time of the
    # initial request for many reasons, e.g. the initial request of a
    # RADIUS client to a RADIUS server may have been dropped by the
    # network, and the first packet the RADIUS server sees is actually a
    # retransmission 3s later.
    #
    # Also, due to a deficiency in the OpenLDAP library, the timeout is
    # not taken into account when setting up an SSL/TLS connection to
    # an LDAP server.  otpd reuses connections to the LDAP server, so
    # this only comes into play when an LDAP connection is not available
    # and a new one has to be established.
    #
    # The default is 11,700 ms, to account for aggressive (but typical)
    # RADIUS client settings of 3s retransmissions with 3 retries, with
    # a generous 300ms padding to absorb our own timing errors and allow
    # for retransmission with gsmd.
    #
    # Different otpd's can safely have different timeout settings.  The
    # value should be chosen based on the auth server interface to each
    # otpd.  That is, for an otpd on a RADIUS server, check the settings
    # (and consistency!) for timeouts on the RADIUS clients, but
    # generally the default 11,700ms is good.  But for an otpd that
    # authenticates ssh logins, the timeout can be much longer, slightly
    # less than the LoginGraceTime setting, 120s by default, so 118,500
    # might be good (since the timeout here is so long, we can afford to
    # include much more slop).  For an otpd that serves multiple
    # authentication servers, the timeout must be the smallest one that
    # prevents client timeout.  It may make more sense to run multiple
    # instances of otpd.
    #timeout = 11700

    # Some tokens have what we call a "hard PIN"; users enter a PIN into
    # the token to activate it.  This has the advantage that only the
    # user knows the PIN, and that it is only entered into a secure
    # device, however, it has a usability disadvantage.
    #
    # Other tokens do not have a keypad, and the user enters a "soft PIN"
    # as part of the passcode.  This has the advantage of a better UI,
    # but has the disadvantages that the PIN is susceptible to capture,
    # which can reduce the token to a single factor device; and that the
    # server admins know the PIN.  (Note that it doesn't matter for hard
    # PIN devices that admins don't know the PIN, since they know the
    # token secret; the loss incurred by admin exposure is not for security
    # of the device, but compromise of personal information.)
    #
    # For simple guessing attacks, soft PIN (especially our implementation,
    # which allows alphanumeric PINs) improves security by increasing
    # the amount of guesswork an attacker has to do.
    #
    # The prepend_pin setting toggles whether the user must prepend (yes)
    # or append (no) the soft PIN; the default is yes (prepend).  Note
    # that hard PIN devices can utilize a soft PIN as well.
    # The defalt is yes.
    #prepend_pin = yes

    # The number of consecutive failed logins before a user is locked out.
    # A locked out user must have their state reset by an adminstrator.
    # A value of 0 disables this function.
    # The default is 0.
    #hardfail = 0

    # Since hardfail isn't very useful (ANYONE can lock out ANY user),
    # we also have a softfail option.
    #
    # After <softfail> consecutive failures, the user is put into "delay
    # mode".  In this mode, a minimum delay between authentication
    # attempts is imposed, during which time all attempts fail regardless
    # of passcode correctness.  The delay starts at 1 minute and doubles,
    # up to a maximum of 32 minutes, for each additional attempt.
    #
    # Either hardfail or softfail is required to prevent a passcode
    # guessing attack; with such a small passcode space, such an attack
    # would be trivial without an imposed rate limit.
    # The default is 5.
    #softfail = 5

    # Tokens that are event synchronous can easily lose sync with the
    # server, e.g. if the user plays with the token they will increment
    # the token's event counter, leaving the server behind.  Or if they
    # simply mistype the passcode they will also be out of sync.
    #
    # So, we need to allow for the user's token to get ahead of the
    # server's state.  This value is the max number of events the server
    # will tolerate the user being ahead.  BE CAREFUL setting this value,
    # it is also the number of responses that will be accepted.  Doubling
    # this value also doubles the chance of a random guess being correct!
    #
    # The default is 5.  Before increasing this value, please read our
    # passcode guessing paper (at http://www.tri-dsystems.com/) to
    # understand the implications of setting this too high.
    #ewindow_size = 5

    # A small value of ewindow_size is paramount to defending against
    # brute force guessing, however it is at odds with the very common
    # situation of the user's token getting "very" far ahead of the
    # server's state.
    #
    # A small value of softfail is also critical to security, but
    # the delay mode is frustrating to legitimate users.
    #
    # To overcome these two issues, this option sets the "resync window",
    # which is how far the server will look ahead, without any forced
    # delay, if the user enters TWO CONSECUTIVE CORRECT passcodes.
    #
    # The default is 25.  Because it is exponentially more difficult
    # to guess TWO passcodes, it is safe to use a largish value here.
    # A value of 0 disables this feature.
