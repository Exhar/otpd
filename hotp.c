 * This implements HOTP per RFC4226, for Digit = 6, 7, 8, 9.
 * (Not explicit in RFC4226, except mentioned as an aside in section E.2,
 *  the maximum OTP length is 9 digits due to the 32-bit restriction in
 *  step 3.  Note that sample code in RFC4226 is wrong in that they allow
 *  Digit = 1-5 as well; RFC4226 is explicit that the minimum value for
 *  Digit is 6.)
 *
 * The HOTP algorithm is:
 * 1. HS = HMAC-SHA-1(K, C)
 *    Take the SHA-1 HMAC of the key (K) and counter (C).
 * 2. S = DT(HS)
 *    Take the "Dynamic Truncation" of the HMAC.
 * 3. HOTP = StToNum(S) % 10^Digit
 *    Take the modulus of S as a bigendian integer.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.  output is the ASCII HOTP on success.
